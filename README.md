# Plimsoll

Plimsoll is the newest versions of the Severn Bronies website. It's a WordPress theme packed with a whole bunch of functionality relating to our events management.

**We're shipping first, asking questions later.**

A perrenial problem with keeping our old site up to date is how long it took to make changes. Lots of parts were interconnected and difficult to change without the risk of breaking something else. Perfection was unobtainable, and even modest improvement was increasingly difficult to achieve.

So to hell with it.

For this site, we've thrown out the baby and the bath water, rebuilt everything from scratch and stripped the requirements to right down to the core. Right now, it's a simple, ugly, scrappy little site that does the minimum required of it and little more. It's from that foundation that we're going to build anew.

We want to work fast. We benefit a lot from not storing any kind of sensitive information barring some admin emails, passwords and API keys. We can afford to _move fast and break things_ with little risk of leaking personal data or subverting democracy. So let's do that.
